## About:
<p>
Wordle-Max is a online word-guessing game that challenges players to guess a five-letter word within six attempts. In the game, the player is presented with a blank grid of five boxes and a list of potential letter choices. The player then selects a combination of letters to fill the boxes, and the game provides feedback by highlighting correct letters in green and correct letters in the wrong position in yellow. The player must use this feedback to refine their guesses and ultimately guess the correct word within six tries. Wordle has gained popularity for its simple yet addictive gameplay and has become a popular pastime for people of all ages.
